            <li>Being a good communicator is an attribute that invariably finds its way onto every list of highly desirable qualities for any project manager, worldwide.
               And with good reason: Communication plays a critically important role in Project Management. 
               If you do not communicate with your team, they will not know what they are supposed to do, or when.And, in turn, if you do not know what your team is doing, 
                you will not be able to monitor the progress of your project, 
                which will then lead to failure of the project. </li><br><br>
            <li>nteractive Communication is a fairly self-explanatory term. As the name suggests, it is a multidirectional form of communication. 
               When you require an immediate response, and when the information you are communicating is sensitive with the possibility of being misinterpreted, 
               you turn to interactive communication. It involves one or more people exchanging thoughts and ideas, where participants respond in real-time.</li>
            <li>Push communication includes memos, letters, emails, reports, faxes, etc. It is not face-to-face but is instead typically done through some written medium.
               The one disadvantage of this type of communication is that the sender can only identify that the message has been successfully sent. Some email systems 
               can notify you when an email has been opened, but this feature can’t guarantee that the recipient has understood the message trying to be communicated.</li>
            <li>Pull communication doesn’t involve pulling in a reader to read your message. Instead, pull communication is all about providing group access to common 
               information. The receiver, however, must recover this information. This method is used for a large audience who require access to information 
               for their use.</li>
